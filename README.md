A handpicked list of __14874__ unique color names from various sources and thousands of user submissions. [Try it yourself](http://codepen.io/meodai/full/mEvZRx/) or read [the full list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ny2oB7g5Tof9TmKiaaDFv25XSCRt-LlBRJhIDz_3Mo/pubhtml?gid=40578722).

> The names of color function like a thread attached to a frightfully slender needle, capable of stitching together our most delicate emotions and memories. When the needle hits the target, we feel either pleasure or emathy. **Kenya Hara ‚Äì White**


## About üìã

The aim of this project is to create as large a list as possible of color names. We've merged various [lists](#sources-), modified the names when there were duplicates with different hex values, and shifted the colors a bit when there were identical colors with different names.

## [Submit a name üåà](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbS5D6owA4dQupJJ-6qhRzuxkjX9r2AliPMg-VR2V3NpGkQg/viewform)

## [Color distribution](https://codepen.io/meodai/full/zdgXJj/) üõ∞

When coming up with new color names, it is vital to know what spots in a certain color-space are crowded and where there is still room for new colors. For example; Our API returns the closest `RGB` color to a given `HEX` value. To avoid that to many colors snap to the same name, we aim to distribute the colors evenly in the color space: [Visualization](https://codepen.io/meodai/full/zdgXJj/) PS: you can choose between different color spaces on the bottom right.

### Installation JS üì¶

```
npm install color-name-list --save
```
or
```
yarn add color-name-list
```

### CDN üåç [JSON](https://unpkg.com/color-name-list/dist/colornames.json), [CSV](https://unpkg.com/color-name-list/dist/colornames.csv), [YML](https://unpkg.com/color-name-list/dist/colornames.yaml)


### Experimental API üÉè

```
https://color-names.herokuapp.com/v1/{{hexvalue without the #}}
```

ex: `curl `[https://color-names.herokuapp.com/v1/060606](https://color-names.herokuapp.com/v1/060606)

```
{
  "query":"060606",
  "name":"Black Metal",
  "hex":"#060606",
  "rgb":{"r":6,"g":6,"b":6},
  "isExact":true
}
```


### Usage JS ‚å®

#### Exact Color

```javascript
import namedColors from 'color-name-list';

let someColor = namedColors.find(color => color.hex === '#ffffff')
console.log(someColor.name) // => white

let someNamedColor = namedColors.find(color => color.name === 'Eigengrau')
console.log(someColor.hex) // => #16161d
```

#### Closest Named Color

Since there are 16581375 possible RGB colors, you might use a library to help you
find the the closest named color.

```javascript
import namedColors from 'color-name-list';
import nearestColor from 'nearest-color';

// create Object needed for 
let colors = {};

namedColors.forEach(color => {
  colors[color.name] = color.hex
});

nearestColorName = nearestColor.from(colors);

// get closest named color
nearestColorName('#f1c1d1') // => Fairy Tale
```

**Note**: In this example we are using [nearest-color](https://github.com/dtao/nearest-color).
it is not the most accurate method, but by far the quickest since it looks for 
the nearest RGB neighbor. If you are looking for something visually more accurate, you
might use a library returning the color with the closest [DeltaE](https://github.com/zschuessler/DeltaE)
based on the Lab color-space.

#### Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

In the process we try to remove all names that are offensive or racist, as well as protect brandnames.
As some of the color names come from other lists, it might happen that some bad ones slip in. [Please report them](https://github.com/meodai/color-names/issues), they will be removed as quickly as possible.
