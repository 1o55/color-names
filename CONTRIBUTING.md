# Contributing

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Adding colors

1. Only update the `src/colornames.csv` file and run `npm run build`
2. Make sure the name nor the hex value are already in use. `npm run test` will test that for you.
3. Update the README.md with the source of your colors, unless you invented that color, in this case 
   add your self to the contrubutors in the README.md
